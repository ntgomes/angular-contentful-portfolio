# Angular-Contentful Portfolio
A template for a portfolio/resume website using Angular (v11) and Contentful CMS. Features a resume download button, blog posts and projects pages, and social media icons as a footer. It's also responsive for mobile screens.

This general structure for this website is inspired by [Erxk's guide on building a blog website using Angular (v2+) and Contentful CMS](https://itnext.io/angular-headless-cms-6a8c7c77af54?gi=7395d47b1bba), but adapted to serve as a portfolio website template I found using Figma:
